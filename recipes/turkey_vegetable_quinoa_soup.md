1 lb ground turkey, cooked and drained
1 medium onion, diced 
2 cloves garlic, minced 
2 medium carrots, chopped

1-15 oz can diced tomatoes 
2 bay leaves 
1 tsp dried thyme 
1/3 cup chopped fresh basil 
2 cups cooked quinoa

## Directions
Heat 2 Tbsp olive oil in large, heavy-bottomed stockpot over medium-low heat.  Once hot, cook ground turkey and drain.  Set turkey aside on plate and cover. 
Add the rest of the olive oil, once hot add onion and cook until tender, about 5 minutes.  Add the garlic, and cook for 2-3 minutes.  Add the carrots, celery, zucchini, and green beans and continue to cook for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. 
Add the vegetable broth, diced tomatoes, bay leaves, thumb, and basil.  Reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook until the vegetables are fork tender, approximately 25 to 30 minutes.  Stir in the cooked quinoa and season with salt and pepper, to taste.  Serve warm.
