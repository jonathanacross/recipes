# Banana and Blueberry Cake

What we love about this recipe - apart from the fact that it tastes AMAZING - is that there are no complicated techniques involved in its preparation. You just put everything in one bowl, mix it all together, and you're done! If you have little baking experience and you're worried about making a mess of baby's first birthday cake, then this is the recipe to try - it's almost foolproof!

## Ingredients
* 4 oz (1 cup) old fashioned rolled oats
* 5 oz (1 1/4 cups) whole wheat flour
* 4 oz (1 cup) all purpose flour
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 2 tsp baking powder
* 2 1/2 tsp cinnamon
* good pinch of salt
* 6 medium ripe bananas, peeled and mashed
* 4 fl oz (1/2 cup) unsalted butter, melted
* 1/2 cup blueberries, chopped (use fresh, or frozen berries thawed and drained)
* 4 eggs, beaten well
* 6 fl oz (3/4 cup) frozen unsweetened apple juice concentrate, thawed

You can use regular apple juice concentrate instead for a sweeter result, but do bear in mind that the recipe will be a higher in sugar than if you use the unsweetened variety. 

## Directions

Preheat the oven to 350 deg F (175 deg C).  Put the first seven ingredients into a large bowl and mix them together.  Add all the rest of the ingredients and stir well until thoroughly combined.  Grease a 9 inch cake tin and pour in the mixture.  Bake for around 50 mins to one hour, until a sharp knife inserted into the centre comes out clean.  Cool in the tin for 20 mins, then turn out on a wire rack to cool completely.

To make the cream cheese frosting,
Stir together one 3 ounce package of cream cheese, 1/4 tsp of vanilla and 2 1/2 tbsp regular frozen apple juice concentrate (thawed). Spread over the top of the cake once it's cool.
