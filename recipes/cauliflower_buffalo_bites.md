# Cauliflower Buffalo Bites

## Ingredients

* 1/2 cup brown rice flour
* 1/2 cup water
* pinch of salt
* pinch of granulated garlic powder
* non-stick spray
* 1 teaspoon butter
* 1/2 cup frank's read hot sauce

## Directions

Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.

In a small bowl, combine brown rice flour, water, garlic powder and salt.  Mix thoroughly with a whisk.

Dip cauliflower pieces in the batter until coated evenly, then place on a lightly greased, non-stick baking sheet.

Bake for about 10 minutes or until the batter hardens, then flip with a spatula and bake for another 5 minutes.

Whisk together the hot sauce and butter in a small bowl.

When the cauliflower is finished, take a plastic pastry brush and evenly brush each piece with the hot sauce mixture.

Bake coated cauliflower for an additional 8-10 minutes, or until cauliflower is crispy, and sauce looks absorbed.

Remove from oven.

Let cauliflower bites set out for at least 20 minutes before serving.
