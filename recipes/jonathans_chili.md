# Jonathan's Chili

Takes 2 hours.
Makes 6 servings.

## Ingredients
1 pound ground beef
1 cup onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, minced
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 habanero pepper, minced
1 green pepper, chopped
2 carrots, chopped
1 (28 oz.) can crushed tomatoes
1 (6 oz.) can tomato paste
1 (7 oz.) can chopped green chilies
2 (15 oz.) cans kidney beans
1 (6 oz.) can corn
1 (4 oz.) can sliced black olives
2 cups water
1-3 teaspoons cumin
2-4 teaspoons chili powder
1/2 teaspoon oregano
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/8 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 cup fresh parsley, chopped

## Directions
Saute the beef, onion, and garlic slowly in the olive oil.  Add the green pepper, carrots, and habanero pepper and saute until soft.  Add the tomatoes, tomato paste, chilies, water and seasonings.  Continue simmering over low heat for a few minutes.  Finally, add the kidney beans, corn, and olives and simmer for an hour and a half.  If additional liquid is needed, add water so the mixture has the consistency of thick soup.

Excellent with cornbread.  Optional good toppings for the chili: sour cream, shredded cheese, chopped scallions, shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes, diced avocado or crumbled corn chips.
