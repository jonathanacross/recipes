# Buckwheat crepes

18-20 crêpes

## Ingredients

2 cups (500 ml) whole milk 1 tablespoon sugar 1/4 teaspoon sea salt 3 tablespoons (80 gr) butter, salted or unsalted, melted 1/2 cup (70 gr) buckwheat flour 3/4 cup (105 gr) all-purpose flour (In France, I use type 65) 3 large eggs

## Directions
In a blender, or with a whisk, mix together all the ingredients until smooth. Cover and chill overnight.

It’s best to let the batter chill overnight, but let it come to room temperature prior to frying them up. And keep stirring the batter as you go while frying since the flour tends to sink to the bottom.
