# Fondue

Takes 40 minutes.
Makes about 4 servings.

## Ingredients

### Fondue
½ pound Gruyere (get good cheese!)
½ pound Emmentaler
2½ cups dry white wine (e.g. Alsatian Riesling)
2-3 cloves of garlic
cornstarch
1-2 tablespoons kirsch
white pepper

### Dippings
baby potatoes
french bread
cornichons
pickled onions

## Directions
Cut the garlic into halves. Simmer the wine and garlic together for about five minutes, and then remove the garlic (which may be thrown away).

Grate the cheese, and mix with cornstarch so that the cheese is evenly coated.  Gradually add the cheese to the wine, stirring constantly. Make sure the cheese is melting, but not boiling.

Stir in the kirsch and white pepper and continue heating for a few minutes so that the fondue is thick. A little butter or cream may be added to give a smoother texture.  Serve immediately.

For the dippings: boil the potatoes (start before the fondue).  When the fondue is almost ready, cut up the bread into cubes, and arrange the potatoes, cornichons, and pickled onions in plates or bowls.

Variations: Raclette may be substituted for Gruyere for a smoother, softer fondue (but doesn't have the bite of Gruyere!).  Paprika and cayenne pepper may be added to taste; also nutmeg may be added.
