# Pie crust

9-inch pie shell

## Ingredients
* 1 1/2 cups flour
* 3/4 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 cup shortening
* 3-4 tablespoons ice water

## Directions
Mix the flour and salt. cut in the shortening with a pastry cutter or two knives.  Combine lightly only until the mixture resembles coarse meal or very tiny peas: its texture will not be uniform but will contain crumbs and small bits and pieces.  Sprinkle water over the flour mixture, a tablespoon at a time, and mix lightly with a fork,  using only enough water so that the pastry will hold together when pressed gently into a ball.

Roll the dough out 2 inches larger than the pie pan, then fit it loosely but firmly into the pan.  Crimp or flute the edges.  For a baked pike shell, prick the bottom dough all over with a fork and bake the shell for 16-18 minutes in a preheated 325 degree oven.  Open the oven door once or twice during the baking and see if the shell has begun to swell up in spots; if it has, push it down gently.
