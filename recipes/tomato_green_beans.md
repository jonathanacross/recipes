# Tomato Green Beans

Takes 0.5 hours.
Makes 2-3 servings.

## Ingredients
2 medium tomatoes
0.5 pound green beans
2 cloves garlic
fresh ginger
0.5 jalapeno pepper
1 teaspoon cumin
1 tablespoon olive oil

## Directions
Mince the garlic, ginger, and jalapeno.  Remove the skins and mince/puree the tomatoes.  (A food processor is helpful for this part.)
 
Fry the garlic in the oil until it turns golden.  Add the ginger, jalapeno, cumin, and a little water, and saut√© for a minute or two.  Add the tomatoes, and enough water to make a broth (enough to cover the green beans). 

Once the tomato mixture is bubbling, add the green beans and cook until the beans are done, about 7-10 minutes.
