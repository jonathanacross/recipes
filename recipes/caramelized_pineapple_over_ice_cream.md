# Caramelized Pineapple over Ice Cream

Makes 6-8 servings.

## Ingredients
* 1 pineapple
* 1/2 cup butter
* 3/4 cup brown sugar
* 1 cup fresh squeezed orange juice
* timid dash of cinnamon
* 1/4 cup macadamia nuts, coarsely chopped
* 2-3 tablespoons rum
* decent vanilla ice cream

## Directions
Obtain a nice pineapple and cut it. It doesn't matter exactly what shape you choose for your pineapple pieces. Some people like wedges, others rings, while I went for chunks because it cooks a bit faster. Set the pineapple aside.

Pick a nice big skillet. You want something that's wide but not deep. The point is to maximize surface area so that we have faster evaporation and therefore caramelization. Melt the butter over medium heat and then mix in the brown sugar and orange juice until the sugar dissolves. Add the cut pineapple pieces and bring to a simmer. Very timidly sprinkle in the cinnamon. We're trying to add depth here without creating an overwhelming cinnamon flavor. Hold the concoction at a simmer for 15 to 20 minutes until it thickens, stirring occasionally.

Meanwhile, chop the nuts and toast them in an oven at 325 degree until golden brown. Watch them closely, because the difference between golden macadamias and charcoal happens fast. Remove the nuts and set them aside.

Remove the skillet from heat and pour the rum over the top of the pineapple mix. At this point you may light the skillet on fire, for effect, or skip to the next step. I like fire and theatrics, but it really isn't needed for this dish.

To serve, scoop vanilla ice cream into bowls, top with the warm pineapple. The pineapple can be quite sweet, so take that into account when scooping. Serve immediately as the ice cream starts to melt. You should have enough for 6-8 people.
