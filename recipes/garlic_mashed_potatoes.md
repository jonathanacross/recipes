# Garlic Mashed Potatoes

Takes 2+ hours.
Makes 6-8 servings.

## Ingredients
* 8 potatoes
* 1 head of garlic
* 1 can of chicken broth
* olive oil
* 1 tablespoon butter
* 1-2 carrots
* 1 package frozen spinach
* salt
* pepper

## Directions
First, slice off the top of the garlic and cut to expose all the cloves. Pour on olive oil, and wrap tightly in aluminum foil. Bake at 350° for 60-70 minutes.  Then, press to extract the garlic and mash up with a fork.

To make the potatoes, peel the skins, cut in pieces, and boil in water.

While the potatoes are boiling, cut up the carrots in small pieces and sauté slowly. (Takes perhaps 35 minutes.)  Also boil the spinach and squeeze the water out (takes 15-20 minutes).

Mix the potatoes, carrots, garlic, spinach, and butter together and mash.  Add the chicken broth as needed to keep everything moist.  Add salt and pepper to taste.
