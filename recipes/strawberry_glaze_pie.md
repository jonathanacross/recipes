# Strawberry Glaze Pie

Takes a while, plus 2 hours cooling.
Makes 6-8 servings.

## Ingredients
1 pie crust
1-1 1/2 quarts strawberries
1 nine-inch pie shell
3 ounces cream cheese (Philadelphia brand is best)
3 tablespoons cornstarch
1 cup sugar
whipped cream/vanilla ice cream

## Directions
Bake a single 9" pie shell and cool.  You can buy frozen pie crusts at the store.  They aren't as good, but they are easier if you don't have time to fool around!

Wash, drain and hull 1 quart of strawberries (I use slightly more, up to another 1/3 quart).   Spread softened cream cheese (either nuke it for 10-15 seconds or just get it out of the fridge an hour early) over the cooled pie shell.  Top the cheese with the choicest half of the berries.

Put the remaining berries in a saucepan and mash and strain until they are pulpy and runny.  Add enough water to make 2 cups of juice; add 3 tablespoons cornstarch to roughly 1/4 cup of this juice in a separate bowl. Set aside cornstarch/juice mixture until later. 

Bring the mashed strawberries and juice to a low boil and gradually add 1 cup sugar (or slightly less if desired).  Cook over low heat, stirring constantly until boiling.  Boil 1 minute.  Stir in juice/cornstarch mixture and stir until thickened and clear. Cool.  Pour over the berries in the pie shell.

Chill 2 hours and serve with oodles of whipped cream on top or vanilla ice cream on the side.
